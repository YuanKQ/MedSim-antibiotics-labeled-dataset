# MedSim-antibiotics-labeled-dataset
commonly used antibiotic semantic similarity labeled dataset

# Description
We select 52 most commonly used antibiotics of 10 categories in hospital with the combination of which we get 1326 antibiotic pairs. From the perspective of clinical application, doctors score the similarity between two antibiotics, which ranges in [0, 1] (unsimilar, 0; extremely similar, 1), according to both antibacteria spectrum and efficacies of medicine. To make antibiotic pairs labeling more accurate, each pair is labeled by at least 3 doctors and finally the average is taken.  

Each row represents an antibiotic pair and the simiality score annotated by doctors in the dataset(antibioitc_1326_sim.csv).
